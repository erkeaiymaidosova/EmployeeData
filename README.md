Project Description for Employee Management Database
The Employee Management Database project is designed to store and manage important information about employees in a company using an employee table. It makes it easy to add, update, and view details for each employee.

Main Features:
Employee Records: Stores information like id (a unique number for each employee), name, position (job role), salary, and hireDate (the date they were hired).
Data Entry and Updates: You can add new employees using an INSERT command and make changes to existing records with an UPDATE command.
Easy Searching: Find employees based on different criteria like their job role, salary, or when they were hired.
Expandable: More columns can be added if needed to track extra details about employees in the future.

Examples of What You Can Do:
Add a new employee to the database.
Change an employeeâ€™s job title or salary.
Search for employees who joined on a certain date.
